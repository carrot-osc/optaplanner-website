  void addProblemFactChange(String containerId,
                            String solverId,
                            ProblemFactChange problemFactChange);

  void addProblemFactChanges(String containerId,
                             String solverId,
                             List<ProblemFactChange> problemFactChange);

  Boolean isEveryProblemFactChangeProcessed(String containerId,
                                            String solverId);
